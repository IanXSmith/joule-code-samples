# Doorbell in javascript*
## Introduction

This smart doorbell application is part of a series of how-to Intel® IoT Platform code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Joule™ development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Joule™ development board, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Joule™ development board platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Joule™ development board or Intel® Galileo board.<br>
- Store the doorbell ring data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft\* Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using Microsoft Azure\* IoT Hub, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Joule™ development board, this project lets you create a smart doorbell that:
- issues an audible notification whenever the doorbell is rung;
- issues a visual notification whenever the doorbell is rung;
- keeps track of visitors using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart doorbell makes a noise with the buzzer when the Grove\* Touch Sensor is pressed. In addition, it displays a message on the LCD.

Optionally, doorbell ring data can also be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples Datastore or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* account.

## Hardware requirements

Grove\* Starter Kit Plus, containing:

1. Intel® Joule™ development board
2. [Grove\* Touch Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/ttp223.html)
3. [Grove\* Buzzer](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/buzzer.html)
4. [Grove\* RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html)
5. 3.3 k-ohm resistors (2)
6. Bunch of male to male jumper wires

## Software requirements

1. Intel® XDK IoT Edition
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* account (optional)

### How to set up

To begin, the project already exists as a template in the Intel® XDK IoT Edition. You can follow the following steps to set it up.

1. Under "START A NEW PROJECT" (to the left of the screen), click on Templates
2. Now select "Doorbell" (more to the centre and the right of the screen) as the template that you want to try out.
3. Now, click on continue at the bottom of the screen.
4. This will prompt you to enter a Project Name and also provide you with an option to change the project directory. Enter a project name here.
5. Now it prompts you to take a tour of XDK, up to you if you want to take a tour.
6. Now you have the code in front of you and you can play around with it as you please.

You need to connect to your Intel® Joule™ development board from your computer to send code to it.

Click the **IoT Device** menu at the bottom left. If your Intel® Joule™ development board is automatically recognized, select it.

![](./images/xdk-manual-connect.png)

Otherwise, select **Add Manual Connection**.
In the **Address** field, type `192.168.2.15`. In the **Port** field, type `58888`.
Click **Connect** to save your connection.

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./images/doorbell-overall.jpg)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to the Intel® Joule™ development board correctly. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.
The pin mapping for the Intel® Joule™ development board is not the same as the Intel® Edison board or Galileo board. The Intel® Joule™ development board has 2 breakouts, with each having 40 pins. You also have access to 4 onboard LEDs. The following are the instructions for hooking up the doorbell circuitry.

1. Pin-1 on Breakout-1 is used for the GPIO based sensor here - TTP223, connect this pin to the D2 pin on the Grove\* Base Shield and plug one end of a Grove\* cable connected to the Grove\* PIR motion sensor into the D2 port on the base shield.
2. Pin-26 on Breakout-1 is used as the PWM pin which will be used for the Grove Buzzer. Connect this pin to D5 on the Grove\* Base Shield. Now use a Grove\* Connector Cable to connect the Grove\* buzzer to the D5 port on the Grove\* Base Shield.
3. Pin 1 on breakout-2 is the ground pin and Pin 2 can be used to provide the 5V connection. Connect both these pins to the respective pins on the Grove\* Base Shield.
4. Pins 11 and 13 are I2C0SDA and I2C0SCL, respectively, and are used for I2C bus; these are again on Breakout-1. Plug these pins into a bread board where you would have to create a pull up circuit. This pull up circuit is necessary for the LCD to work. You would be pulling up the voltage on these lines to 5V. You can create this using 2 3.3k-ohm resistors.
5. Plug the other end of the wires from the pull up circuit into the SDA and SCL lines on the Grove\* Base Shield and connect a Grove\* connector cable to connect the RGB LCD to one of the I2C ports on the Grove\* Base Shield.

### Datastore server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/counter/doorbell/inc",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/)

This example needs cloud connectivity for which you would need to unblock the IP ports on the Intel® Joule™ development board. They are done as follows:

	$ iptables –F
	$ iptables –P INPUT ACCEPT
	$ iptables –P FORWARD ACCEPT
	$ iptables –P OUTPUT ACCEPT
	$ iptables –S

## Running the program using Intel® XDK IoT Edition

When you're ready to run the example, make sure you saved all the files.

![](./images/xdk-upload.png)

Click the **Upload** icon to upload the files to the Intel® Joule™ development board.

![](./images/xdk-run.png)

Click the **Run** icon at the bottom of Intel® XDK IoT Edition. This runs the code on Intel® Joule™ development board.

![](./images/xdk-upload-run.png)

If you made changes to the code, click **Upload and Run**. This runs the latest code with your changes on Intel® Joule™ development board.

![](./images/doorbell-output.png)

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

### Determining the IP address of the Intel® Joule™ development board

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Joule™ development board is connected to by running the following command:

    ifconfig
 
You will see output similar to the following:

    wlp1s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr A4:34:D9:06:A1:F8
			  inet addr:192.168.1.137  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
			  inet6 addr: fe80::a634:d9ff:fe06:a1f8%119/64 Scope:Link
			  UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
			  RX packets:39 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
			  TX packets:61 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
			  collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
			  RX bytes:6288 (6.1 KiB)  TX bytes:13215 (12.9 KiB)


The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.137`.
